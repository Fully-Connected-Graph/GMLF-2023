# Machine Learning Refresher

Machine learning as a field relies heavily on complex mathematical concepts. Thankfully, it is not necessary to be a math wizard to create a perfectly functional machine learning model. However, once something goes wrong, it is important to have a an understanding of the underlying theory to debug the problem. This refresher is designed to direct you to the necessary resources to get started with the competition. If you are already familiar with the concepts, then the below resources can serve as a refresher.

## Linear Algebra

Linear Algebra serves as the theoretical foundation of machine learning. It is used to represent data and the operations that are performed on it. In particular, a two dimensional representation of data known as a matrix lies at the heart of machine learning. [3 blue 1 brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) has a fantastic series of videos that explain the concepts of linear algebra in an intuitive manner. We recommend watching the following videos:

- [Vectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=1)

- [Linear transformations and matrices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=3)

- [Matrix Multiplication as composition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkY2DOUCWMU&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=4)

## Statistics

Distributions of data are generally noisy and it is the duty of the model to separate the signal from noise. To ensure that you are not fooled by the inherent stochastic nature of the machine learning, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with some basic statistical concepts:

- [Mean, Median, Mode](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/summarizing-quantitative-data/mean-median-basics/a/mean-median-and-mode-review)

- [Spread](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/summarizing-quantitative-data/variance-standard-deviation-population/v/range-variance-and-standard-deviation-as-measures-of-dispersion)

- [Distributions](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/StatFile/statdistns.htm)

## Machine Learning

There are various commonly used terms that can be confusing to newcomers. Andrew Ng has a legendary course which describes the concepts of machine learning in a clear and concise manner. We recommend that you watch the videos regarding the following topics:

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Linear Regression
- Cost Function
- Gradient Descent
- Learning Rate and Convergence

These topics are discussed in the first half of the course available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sca5rQ9x1cA&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6FNC6YRfRQc_FbeQrF8BwGI&index=4)
.

## Neural Networks

These algorithms comprise the bread and butter of the modern AI revolution. They are used in a wide variety of applications ranging from image classification to natural language processing. We once again turn to 3 blue 1 brown for an intuitive explanation of the concepts behind neural networks. We recommend watching the following video series:

- [But what is a neural network?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&index=1)

- [What is back propagation really doing?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&index=3)

## Practice

Once you've finished the previous sections, you most likely have doubts on how you can apply the theory that have learned into practice. This is perhaps the most time consuming step of the process. However, it is also the most rewarding. We believe that the notebooks in the [1st edition of our machine learning contest](https://github.com/Fully-Connected-Graph/GMLM-2022) is a great way to start. We especially recommended going through the notebooks in the first lecture since they cover the basics of data preprocessing and model evaluation.
