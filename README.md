# Groningen Machine Learning Fortnight 2023

Greetings, welcome to the second edition of the machine learning competition organized by [Fully Connected Graph](https://www.svcover.nl/committees?commissie=programming_committee). Do you wish to apply your hard-learned machine learning skills to a hot real-world problem? Or do you just want to have fun and learn something new? Then we strongly encourage you to participate in this event! The goal of this year's contest is to ultimately build a recommender system that can determine if a player will like a certain video game. The theory behind such a system serves as the basis for all modern social media platforms. Along the way, there will be lectures that will cover aspects of **Matrix Factorization**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **Graph Neural Networks** to get you started and turbocharge your learning.

## Prerequisites

We assume that you possess some familiarity with machine learning and Python. If you have recently taken the Introduction to Machine Learning course, then you are well prepared to embark on this journey. Nonetheless, if you possess the determination to learn, then you are more than welcome to participate. We will provide you with the necessary tools and resources to get you started [here](refresher/orientation.md).

## Event Structure

The event will span two weeks, starting on the 20th of November and ending on the 1st of December. During this period, there will be 3 lectures with an awards ceremony on the final day of the competition. Refer to the table below for the schedule and content of each lecture. Note that the deadline for submissions will at 23:59 on the 30th of November. In addition to submitting predictions, participants will be required to present a short explanation of their model to the audience.

4 | 01/12/2023 | 15:00 - 17:00 | Awards Ceremony | FCG

## Registration for Competition

To participate in the competition, you need to register your team [here](https://forms.gle/cXX3yp6xFRWstaQ18). There can be up to 3 people in a team, however, you can also register as a lone wolf if desired. Once you have submitted the form, we invite you to register your team on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). This is where you will submit your predictions and where the leader board will be hosted. Note that registration is **not necessary** if you simply wish to attend the lectures.

## Rewards

Participants will receive a sticker of our cute mascot. The winning team will receive shirts with the mascot printed on them so they can show off their unparalled machine learning skills (and love for octopi).
