## Recommender Systems

Personally, I don't have a lot of experience myself with recommender systems. But I have compiled a few resources that I think are useful for learning about recommender systems:

- Steven Brunton has a great [Matrix Factorization and Netflix Prize lecture](https://youtu.be/sooj-_bXWgk?si=RGUc9CdCBfZtfqZa) in his SVD lecture series.
- Andrew Ng goes through the mathematics and challenges in his [Recommender Systems lecture](https://youtu.be/9siFuMMHNIA?list=PLoR5VjrKytrCv-Vxnhp5UyS1UjZsXP0Kj).
- [Recommender Systems Handbook](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387858203) is a great book on recommender systems. It covers the basics of recommender systems, but also goes into more advanced topics.
- [Paper](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/statistics/statgen/joul_aut2009/BigChaos.pdf) on the winning solution to Netflix Prize competition.
- [Chapter 9](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/ch9.pdf) on recommender systems from the book Mining of Massive Datasets.


## Practice

- Last year's [Groningen Machine Learning Month][ml-month-2022] has a great set of notebooks to get started with machine learning. The notebooks are available in the `notebooks` links. There are also lecture recording available on YouTube (see the `recording` links).

- [Kaggle][kaggle] is a great place to practice your machine learning skills. It has a lot of datasets and competitions to get you started. You can also find a lot of notebooks from other people to learn from.

## Courses

- [Coursera Stanford Machine Learning][andrew-ng-coursera] from Andrew Ng is a great introductory course to machine learning. It covers the basics of supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and neural networks. And it goes through the math behind the algorithms in a very intuitive way.

- [Google Machine Learning Crash Course][google-mlcc] is a great introductory course to machine learning. It covers the basics of supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and neural networks. It also has a lot of practical examples in Python.

- [Introduction to Deep Learning (MIT)](https://introtodeeplearning.com/) is a great introductory course to deep learning. It covers the basics of neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and more. It also has a lot of practical examples in Python.

## Books

- [Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists][intro-ml-python] by Andreas C. MÃ¼ller and Sarah Guido. This book is a great introduction to machine learning. It covers the basics of supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and neural networks. It also has a lot of examples in Python.

- [An Introduction to Statistical Learning][stat-learning] by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani. This book is a great introduction to machine learning. It covers the basics of supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and statistical learning. It also has a lot of examples in R and Python.

- [Deep Learning][deep-learning] by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. This book is a great introduction to deep learning. It covers the basics of neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and more. It also has a lot of examples in Python.

## Youtube Channels

- [3Blue1Brown][3blue1brown] makes videos about math, science, and more. He has a great series on neural networks and linear algebra.

- [Steven Brunton][steven-brunton] dives deep into the mechanics of machine learning, control theory, and more. He explains practical usage, mathematics and intuition behind the algorithms.

- [Yannik Kilcher](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZHmQk67mSJgfCCTn7xBfew) makes videos about machine learning research papers, programming, and issues of the AI community, and the broader impact of AI in society.
